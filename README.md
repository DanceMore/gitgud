# gitgud

a little utility to help make sure your `~/code` folder is tidy and pushed.

it checks all subdirectories of a given directory for Git repositories and prints a warning message if any repository is in a dirty, incomplete state, or in-progress state... so you can GITGUD and finish all your work :)

the `--debug` flag can be used to print debug information.
